# Favorite Samples & Examples 

## How to open a Cordova project in VS

The [Examples We Like](#examples-we-like/) section featurs projects that were not necessarily created in Visual Studio--we just think they're cool. However, because they weren't developed inside VS, you can't just double-click into the project. 

To open a non-VS Cordova project inside VS, go to 'File > New Project > Add project from existing code', and follow the import wizard.

Or, skip the hassle and VS-ify your project from this handy npm package created by TACO engineer Ricardo Minguez Pablos, [Open Cordova Project in Existing Folder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ocpief). Just install it via npm, and in ```ocpief``` into the command prompt at the root of your Cordova folder. 

## Samples We Made

### Angular JS To-Do List

![ToDoList in Angular](media/cordova-samples/angulartodo.png)

The [Angular JS To-Do List sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/cordova-samples/tree/master/todo-angularjs) is your standard todo list app--so you can add tasks, check them off, and remove them. It features data persistence (both through local storage and through the Azure Mobile Apps plugin) and optionally consumes the Bing Maps service.

We have also written [a guide to walk you through building the sample](http://taco.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/create-to-do-list-app/). Feel free to download the [sample off Github](https://github.com/Microsoft/cordova-samples/tree/master/todo-angularjs) and play around. 

### Cordova Plugins Sampler

The [Cordova Plugins Sampler](https://github.com/ryanjsalva/cordova-simulate-tests) is authored by Cordova expert and longtime Visual Studio engineer Ryan Salva ([@ryansalva](https://twitter.com/ryanjsalva)). Sample this supreme sampling of plugin samples and learn how to use plugins from Battery to Camera to Contacts and more. 

Feel free to download the [sample off Ryan's Github](https://github.com/ryanjsalva/cordova-simulate-tests) and play around. Open this project by following the instructions [here](#how-to-open-a-cordova-project-in-vs/).

## Examples We Like

### Star Track by Phonegap

![Star Track by Phonegap](media/cordova-samples/startrack.png)

Star Track is a Cordova app that allows you to search for songs (tracks), preview a list, and star the tracks in your results. It's built using Framework 7, a jQuery-like JavaScript library. It was created by the Phonegap team and [announced on their developer blog April 2016](http://phonegap.com/blog/2016/04/21/introducing-star-track-by-phonegap/). 

Play around with their [sample on Github](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-star-track). Open this project by following the instructions [here](#how-to-open-a-cordova-project-in-vs/).
